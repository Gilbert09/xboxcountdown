	<p>
		This is a website dedicated to Xbox One and Xbox 360 games and their future release dates.
		This site is owned by a single indivdual, and is being continuously developed and maintained by 
		<a href="http://dysign.co.uk" target="_new">Dysign Web Services</a>. <br /><br />

		We try our best to keep the games and pictures up to date, but we don;t always get them accurate, 
		so if you notice any errors, then please do contact us using the contact button in the top right 
		and let us know where we've gone wrong.<br /><br />

		We plan on expanding the site to have seperate pages for each game with previews, trailers, review scores 
		and hopefully much more. Got a suggestion? Let us know!
